# mac_sender


This is another small and simple script for testing network equipment.

May be useful for testing network equipment and services such as **EVPN** and **VPLS**.

Before running the script, you need to change the values of the variables in the class instance:

*t = MacFlood("vlan.101", 100)*

where:

**"vlan.101"** - the name of the interface through which packets will be sent;

**100** - the number of packets.
